    <h1 class="mb-3">ADHD</h1>
    <p style="text-align: ;"> Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a chronic condition affecting millions of children, often persisting into adolescence. It involves a combination of ongoing issues such as difficulty sustaining attention, hyperactivity, and impulsive behavior.Children with ADHD may experience lowered self-esteem, disrupted relationships, and academic underachievement. Symptoms sometimes diminish with age, but not everyone outgrows ADHD completely. However, individuals can learn successful strategies.While treatment doesn't cure ADHD, it can significantly help manage symptoms. Therapy typically includes medication and behavioral interventions. Early diagnosis and intervention can make a substantial difference in outcomes.</p>
</div>
    <div class="container-xl py-5">
        <h2 class="mb-3"> Causes</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Attention and hyperactivity in children may stem from:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">1-ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder).</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">2-Genetic influences.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">3-Social and educational environment challenges.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">4-Developmental disorders.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">5-Environmental stimulation levels.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">6-Sleep or nutrition disturbances.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Identification often requires a thorough assessment by health and education professionals due to multifactorial interactions.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="container-xl py-5">
       <h2 class="mb-3">Symptoms</h2>
       <p style="text-align: left;">The core features of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) include inattention and excessive activity. Symptoms typically manifest before the age of 12, with noticeable signs emerging as early as 3 years old in some children. ADHD symptoms can range from mild to moderate to severe and may persist into adolescence.</p>
       <p style="text-align: left;">Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) often occurs more frequently in males than females, and behavioral patterns may differ between boys and girls. For instance, boys may exhibit more hyperactivity, while girls may lean towards inattentiveness.</p>
       <p style="text-align: left;"> There are three types of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD):</p>
       <p style="text-align: left;">1-Inattention:</p>
       <p style="text-align: center;">-A child displaying a pattern of inattention may often:Fail to give close attention to details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork.</p><p>-Have trouble focusing on tasks or play.</p><p>-Seem not to listen, even when directly spoken to.</p><p>-Struggle with following instructions and fail to complete schoolwork or household chores.</p><p>-Encounter difficulties in organizing tasks and activities.</p><p>-Avoid or dislike tasks requiring sustained mental effort, such as homework.</p><p>Lose necessary items for tasks or activities, like school assignments and pencils.Easily get distracted.</p><P>-Forget to perform daily activities, such as forgetting to do chores.</p>
       <p style="text-align: left;">2-Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD):</p>
       <p style="text-align: center;"> is a condition where a child exhibits a pattern of hyperactivity and impulsive behavioral symptoms. </p>
         <p style="text-align: center;">- Fidgeting, tapping hands or feet, or squirming in the seat.
 </p>
         <p style="text-align: center;">- Difficulty sitting still in class or other situations. </p>
         <p style="text-align: center;">-Constantly moving, often unable to stay in one place.

 </p>
         <p style="text-align: center;">- Running or climbing in inappropriate situations.
 </p>
         <p style="text-align: center;">- Difficulty playing or engaging in activities quietly.
 </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">- Excessive talking.
 </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">- Impulsivity, answering quickly, and interrupting others.

 </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">- Trouble waiting for one's turn.
</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">-Interrupting conversations, games, activities, or intruding on others. </p>

       <p style="text-align: left;">3-The primary age-appropriate behavior versus Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with hyperactivity and attention deficits: </p>
       <p style="text-align: center;">- The majority of healthy children tend to be restless and may experience occasional inattention. Preschool-age children often have short attention spans and struggle to sustain focus on a single activity, which is typical. Even in older children and teenagers, the duration of attention typically depends on the level of interest. </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">- The same applies to hyperactivity. Young children are naturally energetic and often remain full of energy for an extended period, even after their parents experience exhaustion and fatigue. Additionally, some children naturally have higher activity levels compared to others. It is crucial not to categorize children as having Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) simply because they differ from their peers or siblings in this regard. </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">- Children facing challenges at school but demonstrating good behavior at home or with friends may be dealing with something other than Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Similarly, children experiencing hyperactivity or inattention at home while maintaining unaffected academic performance and social interactions might not necessarily have ADHD.</p>

         <h3 class="mb-3">When should you see a doctor:</h3>
  <p style="text-align: left;">Consult with a pediatrician or family doctor if you're concerned about signs of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in your child. The doctor may refer you to a specialist such as a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, a psychologist, a psychiatrist, or a pediatric neurologist. However, it's crucial to undergo a medical evaluation first to examine other potential causes for these difficulties in your child.</p>

        <div class="container-xl py-5">
            <h3 class="mb-3"> Treatment:</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Standard treatments for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children include medications, behavioral therapy, counseling services, and educational interventions. While these treatments can alleviate many symptoms of ADHD, they don't cure the disorder. It may take some time to determine what works best for your child.
