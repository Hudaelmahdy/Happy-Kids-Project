            <p style="text-align: left;">Emotion and behavior are based on the developmental stage and mood of the child, and each child has an individual mood or mood.Some children may be fun and able to adapt and easily follow a regular and easy routine to sleep, wake up, eat and other daily activities.These children tend to respond positively to new circumstances.Other children are not very adaptable, and may have cases of irregularity in their routines, and these children tend to respond negatively to new situations.There are still children. Others between the two ends of this spectrum.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-3">Infant:</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Longer crying Infants cry because they are hungry or feel uncomfortable or distressed, and for many other reasons that may not be obvious.Infant crying is at its highest in the sixth week of life, where they cry for three hours a day, and crying decreases so that it reaches an hour a day at the age of 3 months usually.When the baby cries, his parents give him food, change his diaper, and look for a cause of pain or discomfort, and if this does not work, holding or walking the infant sometimes helps. Parents should not force crying babies to eat, as they will eat easily if hunger is the cause of their discomfort.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-3">Around 8 months of age:</h2>

            <h3 class="mb-3">At 2 to 3 years old</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
               children begin to test their limits and do what was forbidden to them, simply to see what will happen.The repeated "rejection" that children hear from parents reflects attempts at independence at this age, and although tantrums are heartbreaking for parents and children, they remain normal because they help children express their frustration during a time when they cannot describe their feelings well.Parents can help reduce the number of tantrums by not allowing their children to Some young children have particular difficulty controlling their impulses and need their parents to set tighter boundaries around them so that they can provide some safety and regularity in their world.

              children begin to play in a more interactive way with other children.Although they may not give up their tendency to own dolls, they may begin to participate and even take turns playing.Asserting ownership of toys by saying, "This is mine!" helps establish a sense of self, and although children at this age seek independence, they still need parents close to them for security and support; for example, they may stay away from their parents when they are only curious. To hide later behind their parents when they are afraid.

               children deal with many issues: self-concept, which is laid down by competence in the classroom; relationships with peers, which are determined by the ability to integrate into society and fit well; and family relationships, which are determined in part by the consent children acquire from parents and siblings. Siblings can be role models and valuable and critical supporters regarding what can and cannot be done.This period of life is very active in children, as they participate in a lot of activities, and are eager to explore new activities.At this age, children are eager to learn and often respond well to advice on safety and healthy lifestyles, avoiding high-risk behaviors.
