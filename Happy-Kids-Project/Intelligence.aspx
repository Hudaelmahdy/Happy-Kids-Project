         <p style="text-align: left;">•	Verbal reasoning (vocabulary - understanding - absurdities - verbal relationships).</p>
         <p style="text-align: left;">•	Visual abstract reasoning (pattern analysis – copying – matrices – paper cut bending).</p>
         <p style="text-align: left;">•	Quantitative reasoning (quantitative testing - number series - equation construction).</p>
         <p style="text-align: left;">•	Short-term memory (beads memory – camel memory – number memory – object memory).</p>
         <p style="text-align: left;">•	The test takes between 45 and 90 minutes.</p>

            <h4 class="mb-3">As for how to conduct an intelligence test for children</h4>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                the topic is simple, it is sessions whose duration varies according to the type of test, but there is an estimated time that we mentioned next to each type of test, throughout this period the psychologist sits with the child and conducts the test according to its nature, as some tests require the presentation of pictures, so the specialist does so. Other sections of the test ask the child to answer questions and the section may be related to an activity or action performed by the child as requested by the specialist.

            <h3 class="mb-3">Calculation of children's IQ test results</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
               The total maximum marks of the test are 150 and based on the grouping of each child, and there are special cases that exceed these degrees and ascend to the category of geniuses achieving higher scores than the great, and it is worth noting here that the normal rate of the child's intelligence will be between 85 and 115 degrees, which is the average achieved by most children in intelligence tests, and when the child exceeds the level of 129 degrees, he enters the category of gifted and geniuses.
            </p>
            <h6>After taking an IQ test for children it can be classified into the following groups:</h6>
            <p style="text-align: left;">•	Delayed cognition and learning disabilities: less than 70.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">•	IQ below minimum: 70 to 84.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">•	IQ 85 to 114.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">•	Moderately gifted: 115 to 129, and from us begins the classification known as the "gifted category" who achieve bikes above 115.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">•	Moderately gifted and IQ high: 130 to 144.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">•	Highly talented and IQ very high: 145 to 159.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">•	Exceptionally talented and intelligent genius: 160 to 179.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">•	Deeply gifted and super intelligent: 180.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                You will meet most children at a point of 100 degrees, and children who get a total of less than 70 suffer from problems in intelligence and skills and have learning difficulties, as work must be done to develop and develop their mental and verbal skills and can determine the points that must be worked on with a psychologist, preferably the same specialist who conducted the test for the child because he noticed areas of strength and weakness through answers and communicate with him during the children's IQ test.
There is an important note about the IQ or the total amount of what the child obtained as a result of the children's intelligence test and its relationship to mental age, as the lower the percentage, the less the mental age and there may be a gap between the mental age and the real age of the child.

            <h3 class="mb-3">Tips for developing intelligence in children</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                Educating the child before entering school has a prominent role in developing the skills and abilities of the child and conducting an intelligence test for children helps in its results and evaluation to know the best mechanism for developing the child's skills.
            </p>
            <h6>Here we will give a set of suggestions and tips for the development of intelligence in children:</h6>
            <p style="text-align: left;">1.	Exploiting and encouraging the child's energies and abilities: For example, if parents notice that their child has a high ability to memorize and remember numbers just to look at them once, for example, he must be challenged and presented with a gift or prize, as if, for example, excessive movement and activity are observed in the child that can be used to ask him for help in simple things, but make him feel accomplished and praised after completion.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">2.	Teaching a child language: Some studies say that children who challenge more than one language have a higher IQ and skills than their peers who speak only one language. Here there is more than one way to teach the child languages, either by showing animated films in the language intended to teach him, or reading stories to him in that language and of course after explaining the meanings of the vocabulary in it. Conversation is also important in developing children's language skills.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">3.	Taking into account the child's own inclinations, hobbies and desires and not imposing them on him: for example, we find parents doctors forcing their children to play with medical toys or those who dream of their children becoming doctors do the same! Thus, the child's freedom to have fun and play is restricted, and this will not help develop his skills, the solution is to present options to him and give him absolute freedom to choose what he wants from them, of course, within what guarantees his safety and health.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">4.	The child's participation in playing: This contributes to the development of his verbal skills that he needs to express his ideas, as well as social communication skills with the environment and others, in addition to the development of skills acquired from play, especially if the games are educational.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">5.	Taking into account the child's ability to learn and not forcing him to learn against his will because he will inevitably hate science and study, especially in his early years, when his passion for discovery and knowledge through games.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">6.	Show full interest by adults in everything the child says or does and this will develop his skills and enhance his self-confidence as well.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">7.	Material and moral motivation by providing prizes and gifts and implementing his requests - within reason - as well as praise, praise, thanks and flattery, all motivate the child and thus contribute to the development of his skills and abilities and raise the level of his intelligence.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">8.	Focus on qualitative education and the general potential of the child: because quantitative grades and marks are not always the judge. A child may be smart but have a communication problem or trauma as a result of an accident or medical problem.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">9.	Taking the child to interactive activities and theatrical performances such as puppet theater and children's plays and encouraging him to participate in school and classroom activities.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">10.Attention to sports and physical safety of the child, as it is said a healthy mind in a healthy body.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">11.Answering all the child's questions as much as possible and according to his absorptive capacity, as answering his inquiries and questions motivates him to broaden the horizon and understand things, link and analyze them.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">12.Take advantage of technology and educational channels for children on YouTube and choose what the child deals with on the Internet carefully, without dispensing with traditional games and means to develop the child's skills.</p>
